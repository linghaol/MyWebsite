Hi!</br>
I'm Linghao, this is my first post! The website is designed, organized and managed by myself.</br>
</br>
Hope you enjoy it!</br>

Maybe late, but never absent!

## Welcome to my blog

As you know that this is a personal blog website. It is also an experiment for what I am interested in and what I have learnt, which means it will not be strictly technical. The whole purpose of building such a blog is to find a place where I can share my understanding out.</br>
</br>
I also wish to receive any suggestion from you, guys. If someone can send an email and tell me "Hey, Linghao. XXX in your blog is wrong!" or "Your solution for XXX is stupid and naive, why not consider YYY?". That's exactly what I need! It's always nice to know more about techniques since I am still young enough.</br>
</br>
ANY SUGGESTION MATTERS.</br>
</br>
Many thanks!</br>
</br>
